This is a trial experiment to make sure that things are working.

# Experiment setup
We will use the following parameters for all simulations:
1. 600 reference genomes, genes from 500 will be present in ref db, genes from the
rest 100 will not be present in the ref db.
1. 1M reads for each simulation
1. 1000 genes for each simulation
1. 150bp read length
1. No simulation errors

For sourmash, we will fix the following settings:
1. k=7
1. thresholdBP=100
